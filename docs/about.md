# About Us

Hi there! Welcome to Scrapbook Sports!

This blog was inspired by the documentary [Copa 71](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18163414/) that tells the story of the first women's world cup. The 1971 tournament had been so well hidden that even soccer superstars like Alex Morgan hadn't heard of it before the film makers brought the story to light. One of the women who played in that tournament kept a scrapbook with snippets from the event that helped the film makers put the pieces together. 

This blog is dedicated to the people who preserved their own history when the rest of the world ignored it. We hope to help tell some of those stories.
